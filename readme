Roman Numerals Conversion
Create a Spring Boot API service that will accept a valid Roman Numeral string and return the integer equivalent.
The API should take a single input string and return a valid JSON response with the model:
 
{
   “integerValue”: 0
}

Example Roman Numerals are listed below.
In addition, Roman numerals follow the following rules:
No digit is repeated in succession more than thrice, i.e., I, X and C cannot be repeated more than 3 times.
The digits V, L and D are not repeated. The repetition of V, L and D is invalid in the formation of numbers.
When a digit of lower value is written to the right or after a digit of higher value, the values of all the digits are added
Value of similar digits are also added
When a digit of lower value is written to the left or before a digit of higher value, then the value of the lower digit is subtracted from the value of the digit of higher value
